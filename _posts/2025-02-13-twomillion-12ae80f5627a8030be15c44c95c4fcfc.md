## General Nmap scan:

- I do a quick Syn-Scan in Nmap on all 65k ports in-order to get lists of all possible open ports, and then I do a more targeted scan on the discovered open ports to get service versions.

### Targeted NMAP scan:

![image.png](/assets/twomillion-12ae80f5627a8030be15c44c95c4fcfc/image%202.png)

- here I am getting the service version `-sV` along with the default scripts `-sC`

## 

# Port 80 HTTP Enumeration

- Lets start with running whatweb on the target to see if there is a possible redirect that will reveal the URL we need to add to `/etc/hosts`

## FFuF

```jsx
ffuf -u http://2million.htb/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-big.txt -fc 301

```

- I am filtering out the 301 because it seems the website doesn’t respond with a 404 rather it will treat a 404 as a redirect back to the main page.

![image.png](/assets/twomillion-12ae80f5627a8030be15c44c95c4fcfc/image%204.png)

- Lets visit each of these to see if we notice anything interesting.

![image.png](/assets/twomillion-12ae80f5627a8030be15c44c95c4fcfc/image%205.png)

- after taking a look at all the directories that we discovered `/invite` stood out to me due to it loading weird JS:

![image.png](/assets/twomillion-12ae80f5627a8030be15c44c95c4fcfc/image%206.png)

- ***Notice: (a API endpoint is discovered →  http://2million.htb/api/v1/invite/verify )***
- let's visit the script src=” `/js/inviteapi.min.js`

![image.png](/assets/twomillion-12ae80f5627a8030be15c44c95c4fcfc/image%207.png)

- this is obfuscated JS so we need a tool to beautify and deobfuscate it into a readable format such as the online tool: https://lelinhtinh.github.io/de4js/

![image.png](/assets/twomillion-12ae80f5627a8030be15c44c95c4fcfc/image%208.png)

- now we can see how we can generate our own invite code.
    - Make a POST request to `/api/v1/how/to/generate`  with datatype: `json`
    - Let's craft that request in the burp suite.

![image.png](/assets/twomillion-12ae80f5627a8030be15c44c95c4fcfc/image%209.png)

- since we know the encryption type being used let's use a tool called CyberChef

![image.png](/assets/twomillion-12ae80f5627a8030be15c44c95c4fcfc/image%2010.png)

- lets make a request to `/api/v1/invite/generate`

![image.png](/assets/twomillion-12ae80f5627a8030be15c44c95c4fcfc/image%2011.png)

- Now we have a code. it is encoded with base64.

```jsx
VK68L-CBZFR-AA55W-CLC9Q
```

now using this code we just got lets create an account:

then we get access to a `/access` page and map out the website to see any interesting functionality or endpoints. 

![image.png](/assets/twomillion-12ae80f5627a8030be15c44c95c4fcfc/image%2013.png)

- Lets generate a connection pack:

![image.png](/assets/twomillion-12ae80f5627a8030be15c44c95c4fcfc/image%2014.png)

- another API end point.

**Responde:** 

![image.png](/assets/twomillion-12ae80f5627a8030be15c44c95c4fcfc/image%2015.png)

- content of VPN certificate.

lets use ffuf to discover all the API endpoints. 

### Looking for API end points:

![image.png](/assets/twomillion-12ae80f5627a8030be15c44c95c4fcfc/image%2016.png)

- The endpoint `/api/v1` contained the listing of all the possible API endpoints notice there are some interesting ones like admin.

**Make note of this endpoint:** 

![image.png](/assets/twomillion-12ae80f5627a8030be15c44c95c4fcfc/image%2017.png)

- lets go to this endpoint and send a put request to it

![image.png](/assets/twomillion-12ae80f5627a8030be15c44c95c4fcfc/image%2018.png)

- notice it mentions the parameter we need to provide to it.

![image.png](/assets/twomillion-12ae80f5627a8030be15c44c95c4fcfc/image%2019.png)

- now it wants is_admin lets assume that is a boolean value and lets set it to true.

![image.png](/assets/twomillion-12ae80f5627a8030be15c44c95c4fcfc/image%2020.png)

- now let's check if the user is admin with the other API endpoint:
